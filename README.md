# Stripe Demo
Demo and sandbox for using the Stripe Payments API. Initially this will just be the examples from [https://stripe.com/docs/](https://stripe.com/docs/) in the form of a simple cart and checkout page.

# Getting Started
If you don't already have it, get [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and know how to access it from the command line.

First, you'll need to download some dependencies.
```shell
$ npm install
```

Next, go ahead and build the project using gulp.js.
```shell
$ gulp
```

Then serve the `build` directory:
```shell
$ npm start
```

And finally, view the demo in your browser at `localhost:8001`.
